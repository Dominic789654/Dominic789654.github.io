Xiang Liu is currently pursuing his Master's degree at The University of Hong Kong (HKU). His academic interests lie in language model pre-training and fine-tuning, chain-of-thought, machine learning, and Kaggle competitions. Xiang's major work, particularly in language learning model pre-training and fine-tuning, was conducted during his intensive internship at the HKUST Statistics and Machine Learning Research Group. This hands-on experience significantly honed his skills and expertise. He also worked on Semantic Parsing, Logical Reasoning, and Coreference Resolution during his subsequent internship at Baidu Research's Cognitive Computing Lab.
